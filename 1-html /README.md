## Before You Begin

1. Create a folder called coding_course. This will be used to store all of your files for this entire course, so keep it in an easy to reach / memorable place
2. Create a folder within that called session_1. This will be used to store all of your files for this session

Now we're ready to start making a website!


## Task One

1. Open the session_1 folder created in your text editor of choice (sublimetext, atom...)
2. Write "Hello"
3. Save this file as index.html in the session_1 folder
4. Open index.html in your browser of choice (chrome, firefox...)

We use index.html as our homepage as we may have other files in our folder, such as about.html and contact.html

When a user loads our site, they are automatically directed to our index file

## Lesson One

HTML uses a set of elements for different types of content, which defines their value/meaning

For example, a "<p>" element indicates a paragraph and the "<img>" indicates an image

These elements are known as tags. Tags are enclosed by angle brackets, and the closing tag begins with a forward slash

```
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```
