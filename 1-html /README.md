## Before You Begin

1. Create a folder called coding_course. This will be used to store all of your files for this entire course, so keep it in an easy to reach / memorable place
2. Create a folder within that called session_1. This will be used to store all of your files for this session

Now we're ready to start making a website!


## Task One

1. Open the session_1 folder created in your text editor of choice (sublimetext, atom...)
2. Write "Hello"
3. Save this file as index.html in the session_1 folder
4. Open index.html in your browser of choice (chrome, firefox...)

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
