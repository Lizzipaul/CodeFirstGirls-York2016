# Intro to Github

## Lesson One - version control

Example 1

1. Let’s say you're working with another person
2. Together you both have to create a powerpoint presentation for a semminar
3. Before you part ways, you'll create a structure for presentation
4. You work on this, Your partner will work on that...
5. ... Now, you meet again and you've chosen different colour schemes, used different fonts and styles to eachother
6. What if there were a way to automate the merging of your material, where you could choose what to keep and what not to keep?

Another scenario could be you working in your CV
Over the years, you would have made an array of edits to your CV
You'd have to save all the different versions across files
What if you could see exactly what changes you’ve made and where over time?
