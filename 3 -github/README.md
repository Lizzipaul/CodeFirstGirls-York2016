# Intro to Github

## Lesson One - version control

### Example 1

1. Let’s say you're working with another person on a project
2. Together you both have to create a powerpoint presentation for a semminar
3. Before you part ways, you'll create a structure for presentation
4. You work on this, Your partner will work on that...
5. ... Now, you meet again and you've chosen different colour schemes, used different fonts and styles to eachother

What if there were a way to automate the merging of your material, where you could choose what to keep and what not to keep?

### Example 2

1. Another scenario could be you working in your CV
2. Over the years, you would have made an array of edits to your CV
3. You'd have to save all the different versions across files

What if you could see exactly what changes you’ve made and where over time?

### Version Control

Version control, is the key to collaborative software development. You can:

* work in teams on the same project
* easily manage conflicts in code on the same files
* work on different versions all at the same time
* decide what you want to keep and what you want to bin at the end
