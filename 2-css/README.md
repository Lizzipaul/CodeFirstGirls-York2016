# Intro to CSS

## Task One

1. Within your coding_course folder create a new folder called first_site
1. Open the first_site folder created in your text editor of choice (sublimetext, atom...)
2. Write "Hello"
3. Save this file as index.html in the first_site folder
4. Open index.html in your browser of choice (chrome, firefox...)

We use index.html as our homepage as we may have other files in our folder, such as about.html and contact.html. When a user loads our site, they are automatically directed to our index file

## Lesson One - tags

HTML uses a set of elements for different types of content, which defines their value/meaning. For example, a "&lt;p&gt;" element indicates a paragraph and the "&lt;img&gt;" indicates an image

These elements are known as tags. Tags are enclosed by angle brackets (&lt;&gt;), and the closing tag begins with a forward slash. For example

```
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```
